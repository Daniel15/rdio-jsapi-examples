# To Do (possible future additions to this example)

* Playlist view that shows albums from your playlists.
* Center on the screen
* Be smarter about how many albums we load depending on screen size
* Show albums related to the album you had clicked
* Be able to play the album right there
* Nicer menu for changing sort.
* Additional views on your collection, such as reverse sorts, random shuffles, etc.
* Other views, like heavy rotation, recently listened, etc.
* Use local storage to remember what you last had up, so it can be displayed immediately instead of having to re-fetch.
* If run on desktop, launch a new rdio.com webpage instead of the desktop app when you click on an item?
* Make the page long enough for the entire collection, then fill it in as needed. 
* Add the word "done" at the bottom when done loading?
* Remember where you have scrolled to
