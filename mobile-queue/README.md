# About

Allows you to manipulate your queue on mobile.

# TODO:

* Make menu items work
* Prettier grip
* Dragging and dropping makes duplicates; maybe when master?
* Should resets be paused while menu is up? Or maybe another way to deal with state changing?
* Optimize for next album... pop top item off of queue right away?
* Determine item from key, not just index
* Hold off on sending move if there's a reset in progress
* If updates are coming in from elsewhere, hold off on determining drag indices

* Don't allow a second drag while one is in progress
* Show album in menu for context?
* Clean up code so it's a proper example
* Should animate into position when you drop
* Test adding items in the middle to make sure we're doing the right thing
* Indicator that things are updating
* Item is jittery when scrolling during drag
* Variable scroll speed depending on where you are
* Do all animations with transform instead of top?

# Features

* "Play Now and Push Current Item Down"
* Send to top
* Search for new stuff to add
* Possible to bring in items from other apps?
