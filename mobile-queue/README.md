# About

Allows you to manipulate your queue on mobile.

# TODO:

* Scroll while you drag
* Long press
* Don't allow a second drag while one is in progress
* Don't update during drag

* Clean up code so it's a proper example
* Should animate into position when you drop
* Test adding items in the middle to make sure we're doing the right thing
* Indicator that things are updating
* If updates are coming in from elsewhere, hold off on determining drag indices

# Features

* "Play Now and Push Current Item Down"
* Send to top
* Search for new stuff to add
* Possible to bring in items from other apps?
