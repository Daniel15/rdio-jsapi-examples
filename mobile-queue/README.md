# TODO:

* Clean up code so it's a proper example
* Can't drag down
* Should animate into position when you drop
* Scroll while you drag
* Actually rearrange the real queue
* Update "Now Playing" 
* What if there's nothing currently playing?
* Spinner to start
* Queue remove events
* Test adding items in the middle to make sure we're doing the right thing
* Don't allow a second drag while one is in progress

# Features

* "Play Now and Push Current Item Down"
* Drag and drop
* Send to top
* Search for new stuff to add
* Possible to bring in items from other apps?
