# TODO

## High

* Multi-tag select
* Make tag and album subviews for collection-view
* Be able to favorite certain tags
* Be able to see the tags for an album in a way that allows you to click on them to find other albums in your collection with the same tag
* When you click a tag, only show the albums from that tag and also only the tags that those albums have (with updated counts)
* Kevin N wants: http://iangilman.com/rdio/tag-view/rknla so you can see his collection/filters
* Raul A wants: play station or make playlist from a particular tag

## Normal

* Be able to support larger number of albums/tags
* Suggest new albums not in your collection that match certain tags
* Clicking on a tag while things are still loading often doesn't work
* Ability to pause music after you've started it
* Show tag loading progress bar
* If the collection is in local storage, don't load it from Rdio until after all of the tags have been loaded
* iPad support? Need touch hover remove, possibly other stuff
* Should be able to click anywhere in the tag list and hit a tag, not just directly on the text
* Remove albums from storage that have been removed from your collection
* Be able to queue things up

## Low

* Don't rely on the JavaScript object that our albums are stored in to keep them sorted in the correct order?
