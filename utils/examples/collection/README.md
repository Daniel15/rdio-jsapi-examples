# TODO

## Sooner

* Don't do last empty call in load; quit when you know you're done
* Speed test various extras so we know we've got the right set
* More documentation, including config params for collectionAlbums
* Unit tests

## Tests

* Interrupting a load with another load
* If library changes during initial load

## Later

* Track the collection of any user?
