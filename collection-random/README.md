Note that this app requires the "shared_playstate" permission, which you can ask for when you create your own app.

# TODO:

* Spinner for initial load
* During initial load, be more clever about ensuring we don't duplicate
* When you run our of indicies, refresh the list
* Deal with collection add and remove events
* Spinner for queuing
* Add new albums as albums disappear from being queued
* Don't use albums that are already in the queue
